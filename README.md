# Ensemble_Learning
Exploring ensemble approaches with trees and boosting techniques for a classification problem



Our analysis would include pre-processing, hypothesis generation based on intuition, feature engineering, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), exploring different classification algorithms and improving the classification through ensemble techniques. We will concentrate on implifications of existing features, Combinations of existing features and higher order Polynomials.
